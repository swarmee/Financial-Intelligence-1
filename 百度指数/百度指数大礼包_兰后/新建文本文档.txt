@description: help you to check this package

"""

1. "final_index.xlsx" is our data for model.

2. "data_analysis_index.py" is the python profile for our data analysis
	before you run it, remember to use pip to install these following packages: seaborn and keras.
	if you want to see the results directly, go straigtht to "data_analysis_jupyter.pdf" which is exported from Jupyter and I hope 
	the result will satisfy you.
3. "crawler.py" is the python profile for crawling baidu index and recognizing the identifying code.
	before you run it, remember to use pip to install these following packages: selenium, glob, pillow, pyocr and also to download chromedriver.exe
	of course there are some flaws in this original profile and if you have any advice, please contact me (Hou LAN) on wechat.
	if you want to avoid steps above but still eager for our method, you can go directly to our powerpoint because there is an introductory video for this part. 
	However, the version is somewhat out-dated and we've already updated our code.
	
	
	Appreciate your understanding:)!
